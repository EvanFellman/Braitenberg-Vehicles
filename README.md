# Braitenberg-Vehicles

Inspired by: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle

This project is made from scratch. In order to run all you need is Python 3. Each arrow represents a player. Each player is controlled by their own neural network. When a player runs over a yellow square (which is food), it gains food points. If a player runs out of food points (less than or equal to zero), that player will die. If a player gains enough food, it creates a mutated copy (in other words: it has a kid). If we let this program run for a while, we will see the less fit players die and the better fit players survive and reproduce more. Each player will have a similar color to its parent so you can visually see how similar each player is to one another.

This program also has the fun feature where you can click on a player and highlight it. It will also show you the stats of that player. This project is still a work in progress but the main features a complete. The features that I want to add is that I want to improve how the data that is displayed to the user. Other than this, the program is complete.
